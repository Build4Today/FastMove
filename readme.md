# ðŸš€ AI Native Mobile App

React Native app, built with TypeScript 5 and Yarn 3 (berry). This mobile app uses NativeBase for the UI and communicates with a Rails backend where it will generate the AI data and render back to the app.


### Requirements

- [Install Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started/) to make sure the correct NodeJS and Yarn version are installed for this project.
- Make sure your yarn version is correct (needs to be v3). If you are still running yarn v1, please run `yarn set version berry` to make sure you use the Yarn Berry v3 (and not Yarn v1).


### First Run

1. Rename `.env.dist` to `.env`
2. Open `.env` file and update your app details in there
3. Run `yarn start` or `npx expo start`

You can also run `yarn ios` or `yarn android` to run the app directly on the respective device.


### Cleanup Code

1. Verify if the code syntax follows the Prettier rules `yarn prettier:check`
2. To fix the indentation/code styling `yarn prettier:fix`
